    <string name="sender_name">Enter either the complete name or part of that name. For example in case of Bank of Baroda,
        if you receive messages from AX-BOBTXN, AD-BOBTXN, TX-BOBTXN, etc. then you can either put the common part
        \"BOBTXN\" as the name of the Sender. This will help the app filter out and differentiate
        transactional messages of a particular bank.</string>
